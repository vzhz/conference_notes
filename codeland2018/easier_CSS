CSS WAS hard

no one knows anything, leap frog over the feet-draggers
“you can leapfrog over all these bros that are tweeting me telling me I’m wrong”

history of layouts
html - everything is secretly a box, overflow for images
if don’t do anything, you have flow layout
tables hold data but that makes tablet for layers
using html to do styling is evil

Flash
everything in flash 
1st step, make stage of certain size, that was your website, do not make your own scrollbars (hard problem)
we like things that stay in place but that isn’t what the web wants

Flash went away because didn’t show up on google

Semantic markup
anything you should not have put in CSS - absolute positioning

fix the width
it isn’t really “of the web” if you assume a fixed width

“Oh it’s responsive but X”
Now came up with Intrinsic Web Design

Object-fit: cover 
to not squash with fixed width
instead crops the image, can pick the center point
youtube layout land
