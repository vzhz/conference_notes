Learn to code without time and money

“Paperwork engineering” (excel)
2011
pregnant and growing a human is really hard (someone says yes!)

upwark predicensor has $200 for an app - still like this
back to the cubicle, baby, deployment
almost started again but tragedy and no energy

2016
what do I want to do
passion decision, not worried about money because savings
swift vs web
googled “how to become a web dev” hahahaha
skill crush to learn what you want to do

wordpress, customize css, $50-100 pop, but didn’t consider the time talking to people
sucked into the hype

once you get really good at something, focus on one thing

just bouncing around and did the todo app again and again
don’t be distracted by shiny learning platforms

Meeting real people
2008 meetup.com wasn’t good, but tried again, very nervously
one other person and he told about twitter

OS
read blog points
Operation Code for Vets
one issue, “crushing life”
two issue, “I know nothing”
