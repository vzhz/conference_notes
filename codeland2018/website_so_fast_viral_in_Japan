Go viral in Japan

Just to render a webpage, we send you doom
if you don’t design for everyone, you aren’t be inclusive

slow because finally Africa was using youtube
looking to gain market share by being fast

What can we do:
- CDN bring server to users and caching at the edge (near where it’s going to be), not doing Utah and back; make CDN part of your stack
- reduce render-blocking latency; normally wait until slowest resource comes back; CSS is style tag in HTML (stored in edge node)
- Use modern browser features; but don’t reach right away, remember no silver bullet to make your website fast
- Know your constraints
- Write code for humans; assembly would be faster but use the for loop instead because you can read and change/keep up as things change
Do the fundamentals with all your heart
