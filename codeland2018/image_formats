Images on mobile

Images kill data plans
outside of videos, largest source of data on your page

need to optimize your images 
2G, 3G dominate the planet

burn battery
uses up CPU, that’s why you’re going from 10% to 0% while cruising insta

know image formats
example image
GIF: 256 colors, often bloated
PNG: ok but bloated, there are two versions
SVG: for illustrations, logos, maps
WEBP: newer, owned by google, use it - agressive coding format
JPG: made for photography, lossy format

exif data: 200 fields of metadata embedded in image, useless for web so remove from photo, takes 14% of image

picture tag: controls the resource presented to a user based on media query

use devtools

lighthouse (audit, part of chrome)

more formats in notes

images create engagement
imagine instagram without images - whomp!

ave page takes 19 seconds same as Trump meeting Japanese prime minister

shouldn’t be over 1GB
